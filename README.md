# CardShuffle

This project came to be because traditional card shuffling methods are either:
- Not very effective (e.g. they need to be repeated a large number of times before the deck of cards has a reasonable chance of being shuffled).
- Damaging do the cards (e.g. the cards are repeatedly and excessively bent).

This project implements an algorithm that generates a random permutation for a deck of `n` cards and then gives step-by-step instructions on how to obtain that shuffle by either placing the cards on stacks or placing existing stacks on top of each other.
